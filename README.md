# About


> **@trIAge Who are you and what can you do?**


> Hello! I am trIAge, a helpful bot designed to assist users and maintainers of open source projects. I am capable of assessing and rating the quality of issues, giving suggestions on how to improve the quality of issues, pointing users to relevant documentation and other resources, and suggesting solutions to issues. So feel free to ask for my help!

> **See this repository: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca**


> Thank you for providing me with that information. How may I assist you with the stanford_alpaca repository?

> **What do you know about this repo?**

> This repository is called stanford_alpaca, and it contains code and documentation to train Stanford's Alpaca models and generate data. The Alpaca project is an instruction-following LLaMA model, which stands for Latent language learners and models from ambiguity. The repository has 16306 stars on GitHub and is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

> **See [this issue](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/issues/63)**

> This issue, labeled as empty and filed by user jordancole21, requests support for a specific model, gpt-3.5-turbo, in the data generator. It seems that the user is asking for a new feature to be added to the tool. However, it is not clear whether such support is already available or planned for implementation. The repository maintainers may need to provide more information regarding this issue.
