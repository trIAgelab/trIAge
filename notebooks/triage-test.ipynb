Here are some suggestions on how to resolve the issue:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Regarding the use of `#pragma omp` in a lambda function, I would recommend doing some research on how to use OpenMP in C++, as it seems to be integral to the implementation of the PGD algorithm. In particular, you may want to look at how to use `#pragma omp` in conjunction with the `for` loop construct, as this may be more appropriate than using it in a lambda function.\n",
       "2. As for how to handle the `const std::vector<count>&` type, it may be worth exploring whether there is an efficient way to copy the data to a NumPy array and pass it to the Cython interface instead. Alternatively, if a C++/Cython/Python class exists that is `np`-compatible and would allow for no data copy in the Cython interface, that could be used instead. \n",
       "3. To address the question of whether it is a good idea to append 3-graphlets to the start of the vector, it may be worth seeking feedback from more experienced developers or domain experts who can say whether this is a good practice. \n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, once these questions have been resolved, it may be beneficial to include a notebook that demonstrates how the PGD algorithm was implemented, how it works and how it can be used to analyze large-scale networks. \n",
